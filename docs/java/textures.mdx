# Texture Generation

All texture generators available through the JSON system are also available in code; they are located in
`dev.lukebemish.dynamicassetgenerator.api.client.generators.texsources`, and are subclasses of `ITexSource`. An `ITexSource`
can be turned into an `IPathAwareInputStreamSource` by wrapping them in a `TextureGenerator`. For example:

```java
public class ClientExample {
    public static final AssetResourceCache ASSET_CACHE =
        ResourceCache.register(new AssetResourceCache(new ResourceLocation("my_mod", "assets")));
    
    public static void initializeClient() {
        // This method would be run during client initialization from the appropriate location.
        ASSET_CACHE.planSource(
            new TextureGenerator(
                new ResourceLocation("my_mod","block/my_block"),
                new TextureReader(new ResourceLocation("item/apple"))
            )
        );
    }
}
```

This will register a new texture source that copies the `item/apple` texture to `my_mod:block/my_block`.

## Custom Texture Sources

Custom texture sources can be created by implementing `ITexSource`, which requires implementing two methods:

`getSupplier` takes a `TexSourceDataHolder` and a `ResourceGenerationContext`, and returns a `IoSupplier<NativeImage>`, or 
`null` if no texture can be constructed. The `TexSourceDataHolder` is used to hold data that should be passed to "child"
elements of the texture source, such as the logger, which can be retrieved with `TexSourceDataHolder#getLogger`. Note that
making your source's output depend on other data in this element requires implementing the currently-experimental caching
API.

`codec` returns a codec that can be used to serialize or deserialize the texture source. This codec must be registered with
`ITexSource.register`, and is used when caching texture sources; a texture source's generated texture must be fully 
describable by the information encoded by its codec, unless the experimental caching API is implemented for that texture 
source.
