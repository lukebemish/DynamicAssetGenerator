# Dynamic Asset Generator

Dynamic Asset Generator (or DynAssetGen) is a minecraft mod meant to help dynamically generate assets and data at runtime, as opposed to creating them manually or when the mod is compiled. Some possible uses include:
 - Assets that match a player's resource packs
 - Assets based off of vanilla assets, which should not be redistributed
 - Data or assets that depend on config values or other data only known at runtime
 - Data or assets which vary based on the other data and assets present

This mod has both a Java API and a system for controlling the mod through JSON.
